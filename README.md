# Lucky bird

**Description**
My very first game built with Phaser. It is my version of a mini game using Canvas/WebGL.

Each round the user is presented with randomly generated symbols

The rules of the game are very simple and applies to both options:
* The game should display at least 3 symbols randomly.
* Revealing 3 different symbols results in a loss.
* Revealing 2 identical symbols results in a win.
* Revealing 3 identical symbols results in a big win.

The game should be initialized with a dataset. For example:
`{ symbols: ['symbol,'symbol1','symbol9'], prize: 100 }`
